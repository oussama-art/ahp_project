    <p>
        Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
        are decision-making methods used to prioritize alternatives based on multiple criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        AHP helps in structuring complex decision problems into a hierarchical model, where criteria and alternatives 
        are compared pairwise to determine their relative importance. TOPSIS, on the other hand, ranks alternatives 
        based on their similarity to the ideal solution and their distance from the worst solution.

                        Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a decision-making method developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s. 
                        It is used to prioritize alternatives by evaluating multiple criteria in a structured and systematic manner.
